# Morse Code Translator

A Mores Code translator implemented in C. Currently only translates plain text into
binary digits representing the various sequence, listed below.

## Usage information:
```
morse [path]
```
* If a path to a file is specified, the file will be read and converted to Morse Code, which will be outputed to standard output.
* If a path is not specified, a simple REPL will run, where the user can interactively translate messages into Morse Code.

## Build:
To build the project, simply run ```make```.
